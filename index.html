      <b>Abstract.</b>

      Recent singing-voice-synthesis (SVS) methods have achieved remarkable audio quality and naturalness, yet they lack the capability to control the style attributes of the synthesized singing explicitly. We propose Prompt-Singer, the first SVS method that enables attribute controlling on singer gender, vocal range and volume with natural language. We adopt a model architecture based on a decoder-only transformer with a multi-scale hierarchy, and design a range-melody decoupled pitch representation that enables text-conditioned vocal range control while keeping melodic accuracy. Furthermore, we explore various experiment settings, including different types of text representations, text encoder fine-tuning, and introducing speech data to alleviate data scarcity, aiming to facilitate further research. Experiments show that our model achieves favorable controlling ability and audio quality. Audio samples are available at <a href="http://prompt-singer.github.io">http://prompt-singer.github.io</a>.

      The overall architecture of our model is illustrated in Figure (a). It is primarily composed of two sub-modules: 1) the multi-scale transformer, which generates discrete acoustic units conditioned on inputs of natural language prompt, lyrics with duration, and pitch information; and 2) the unit vocoder, which maps the generated acoustic units to an audio waveform.

      The multi-scale transformer serves as the backbone of our model. It is a decoder-only transformer with a hierarchical structure to facilitate the modeling of long sequences. This module aims to generate discrete acoustic units of singing voices conditioned on natural language prompts, lyrics phonemes, phoneme durations and vocal-range agnostic melody representation, together with the vocal-range factor as intermediate output. During training, the conditional inputs and target outputs are concatenated into a single sequence and fed to the transformer, which models the correlation using next-token-prediction with cross-entropy loss calculated on the target output part. During inference, the model predicts the range factor and acoustic units conditioned on the prefix input sequence autoregressively. When the acoustic unit generation finishes, the generated units are mapped to a high-fidelity audio waveform with the unit vocoder.
